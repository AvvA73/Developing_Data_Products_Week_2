# Developing Data Products
# Week 2 - Assignment

## Overview

> Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet. 
Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. 
Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity! 

## My Map
> We now create a map with a marker for the Roman amphitheatre Arena in Verona, Italy.

### Step 1
> Let's create the map.

```{r}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>%
addTiles()
my_map
```

### Step 2
> Let's put a link to our marker.

```{r}
arena <- c("<a href= 'https://www.arena.it/en' >Arena in Verona</a>")
leaflet() %>%
addTiles() %>%
addMarkers(lat=45.43920977360528, lng=10.994333390019815, popup = arena)
```
