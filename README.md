# Developing_Data_Products_Week_2
Repository for Developing Data Products course - week 2

This is my R Markdown document for the first assignment of "Developing Data Products" course. By using the library Leaflet, I've created a map of Verona (Italy)
and added a Marker on the Roman amphitheatre Arena. If you click on the Marker, the link to the Arena website appears.
